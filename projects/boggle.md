I created a program that recreates the classic word game, Boggle. In this game, players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters on a 4x4 grid. The words can be formed in any direction - horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

The program displays the Boggle board and allows players to enter words. It also includes a scoring system that awards points based on the length of the words found.

At the end of the game, the computer will show all of the words that weren't found.

Here's a demo:
