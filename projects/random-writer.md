This project is a program that generates random text that resembles a source
document. The technique is called a Markov model, which is a statistical model
that generates text based on the probability of a word following another word.

## Example Output

Here is text generated from some of Dr. Seuss's books:

> Then we saw one kite!
We saw ALL the things are everywhere.

Why are they
sad and bad?
I do not like it.
Not one little bit!"

"Have no dear, little star.

Say!
Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the cat.
"I will see something new.
I will have to know how.

Thing Two and Thing had to shake hands
With Thing One and Things
And Sally and I
Saw them to you.
Your mother will come.
We did nothing at all.

Some have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing had to stop.
Then I let down my net,
I bet,
as wet as they let
this one,
I think,
is called
a Yink.

Here are slow.
Some have four.
Some are slow.
Some have to open
many cans.
And the gown,
And the string of one kite bump
On the house.
I liked to hold.

My shoe is off.
My foot is cold.

My shoe is off.
My feet stick out
of bed all night
from here to the cake.
You sank our toy ship
And then he fell into a pot!

And this comes from Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing:

LEONATO.
Take their examination these men.

FIRST WATCH.
This is all.

CLAUDIO.
How know you by your daughter?

CLAUDIO.
Can the working this, and then, with public
accusation, and my name is Conrade.

DOGBERRY.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

VERGES.
Yes, I thank her; that she brought Count Claudio may hear, for what I have said against Benedick,
my dear friend Leonato of the matter: that's the
scene that I was the prince's
subjects.
You should have made an oyster; but I'll take my leave. This naughty man 
Shall face to face be brought me up, I
likewise give her to rise.

URSULA.
Well.

[Exeunt.]
