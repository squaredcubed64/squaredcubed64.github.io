This project is a program that generates random text that resembles a source
document. The technique is called a [Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model), which is a statistical model
that generates text based on the probability of a word following another word.

## Example Output

Here is text generated from some of Dr. Seuss's books:

> Then we saw one kite!
We saw ALL the things are everywhere.  
Why are they
sad and bad?
I do not like it.
Not one little bit!"  
"Have no dear, little star.  
Say!
Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the cat.
"I will see something new.
I will have to know how.  

And this comes from Shakespeare's *Much Ado About Nothing*:

> LEONATO.  
Take their examination these men.

> FIRST WATCH.  
This is all.

> CLAUDIO.  
How know you by your daughter?

> CLAUDIO.  
Can the working this, and then, with public  
accusation, and my name is Conrade.

> DOGBERRY.  
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

> VERGES.  
Yes, I thank her; that she brought Count Claudio may hear, for what I have said against Benedick,  
my dear friend Leonato of the matter: that's the  
scene that I was the prince's  
subjects.
